This repository contains files for my Unit Circle CA

DrawAndExplainUnitCircle just draws a unit circle in Drawing Panel

UnitCircleQuiz is a quiz class that tests the user on different trig functions
about the unit circle

In order for the program to work:

1. Download all java files. 
2. Open DrawingPanel.java, and run the file. A bunch of janky class files will appear. Ignore these and move on.
3. Run DrawingPanelTest.java. If a window appears with a circle in the upper left corner, the drawingpanel class is working correctly
4. Run UnitCircleQuiz.java so that the UnitCircleQuiz.class file will appear
5. Run UnitCircleQuizTest.java to play the quiz. Input your answers into output console.

NOTES ON PLAYING THE QUIZ
- trig ratios sin, cos, tan have no radicals in the denominator. Their cosecant, secant, and cotangent counterparts do have radicals in the denominator

- Wrap parenthesis around numbers which are radicalized. For example, radical three should appear as (3)

- Negatives are always first in the ratio. They go before everything. Remember this. The answer -1/2 is valid but 1/-2 is invalid.

- All answers should be ratios. No decimals!
