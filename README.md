# Unit Circle CA
This repository contains files for my Unit Circle CA

DrawAndExplainUnitCircle just draws a unit circle in Drawing Panel

UnitCircleQuiz is a quiz class that tests the user on different trig functions
about the unit circle. The questions ask for the user to input the correct ratio to different trig functions. At the end, the program tells the user which trig functions to restudy based off their answers.

In order for the program to work:

1. Download all files and open them in your preferred IDE. 
2. Open DrawingPanel.java, and compile the file. A bunch of janky class files will appear. Ignore these and move on.
3. Run DrawingPanelTest.java. If a window appears with a circle in the middle, the drawing panel class is working correctly
4. Compile UnitCircleQuiz.java so that the UnitCircleQuiz.class file will appear
5. Run UnitCircleQuizTest.java to play the quiz.
6. Run DrawAndExplainUnitCircle.java to draw a labeled unit circle and to study for the quiz

NOTES ON PLAYING THE QUIZ
- trig ratios sin, cos, tan have no radicals in the denominator. Their cosecant, secant, and cotangent counterparts do have radicals in the denominator

- Wrap parenthesis around numbers which are radicalized. For example, radical three should appear as (3)

	o For example, cos(135) would equal -(2)/2 but sec(135) equals -2/(2)
	
- Some values are simplified to whole numbers. For example, csc(30) = 2, not 2/1.

- Negatives are always first in the ratio. They go before everything. The answer -1/2 is valid but 1/-2 is invalid.

- All answers should be ratios. No decimals!

My explanations for the values used are in written notes which I submitted to schoology.
